            "Company Description: Bridge International Academies operates a franchise-like network of ultra low-cost, for-profit private schools, delivering high-quality education for less than $4 per student per month."
        ],
        "discription": "Description \n Who We Are  \n \nBridgeInternational Academies is the worlds largest and fastest-growing chain of primary and preprimary schools with more than 500 academies and 100,000 pupils in Kenya, Uganda, Nigeria, India, and Liberia. We democratize the right to succeed by giving families living in poverty access to the high-quality education that will allow their children to live a very different life. We leverage experts, data, and technology in order to standardize and scale every aspect of quality education delivery, from how and where academies are built to how teachers are selected and trained, and how lessons are delivered and monitored for improvement. We are vertically-integrated, tech-enabled, and on our way to profitability. Bridge expects to continue its rapid expansion in Africa and India in the coming years. \n \nThe Bridge Offer  \n \nRoughly 2.7 billion people live on less than $2/day. In their communities, there is a huge gap between the education offered and the needs of the population. Too often the schools available to them fail to deliver for these families. The quality offered results in the average pupil from our communities in East Africa failing to reach proficiency in primary school and on average fail the primary exit exams that are critical to their development. Teachers are unresponsive and occasionally abusive, and fees are often unaffordable. Even government schools can cost families a significant amount of money after all the additional fees are added up. With 47% of classroom teaching time lost due to teacher absenteeism or neglect, 55% of families in our communities end up choosing private schools instead, but then fear for the stability and sustainability of their choice as many schools close after only a few years of service. Both the government schools and the private schools tend to lack well-conceived scope and sequences, instructional materials, student achievement data, and the capacity to react to that data. Families are actively searching for a better academic alternative. Enter Bridge International Academies. As of September 2016, Bridge operates more than 500 academies worldwide, serving roughly 100,000 pupils in Kenya, Uganda, Nigeria, India, and Liberia. Bridge utilises a scripted-learning education methodology coupled with 'big data' (all teachers have tablets for instruction, assessment, and data-gathering) that allows us to make curriculum a little better every day. With plans to enrol ten million students ten years from now, Bridge International Academies offers a tremendous opportunity to grow with one of the worlds most exciting, ambitious, and socially conscious companies, with leadership roles available across a number of competencies and geographies.  \n \nTech at Bridge  \n \nTechnology plays a critical role at Bridge in enabling us to provide education at massive scale and low cost  it's one of the key elements that gives us the ability to deliver what no one else can. Tech spans Director of Business Intelligence several key functions, from the hardware and software that our academies use to run all aspects of teaching and management, including mobile payments, to the systems that enable our country headquarters to manage massive local operations, to the data backbone that informs all of our strategic and tactical decision making. Its a lot of custom software development and a lot of back office systems. We've got a ridiculously ambitious mission at Bridge, and it's a place where passionate technologists have a chance to directly change the world. No kidding.   \n \nAbout the Role  \n \nTech at Bridge is a highly complex, vertically-integrated affair, with systems supporting an ever expanding range of functions and countries, and crossing between software development, IT operations, academy operations, and logistics/supply chain. At the same time, our teams run lean and things change fast  governments make policy decisions that affect us, launching new countries is a frenetic affair, and we still need to evolve our core technology offering. Bridge has been data driven from its inception, using a build-measure-learn approach to all aspects of service delivery. As a scale model business, we have an unprecedented opportunity to bring statistical power to all aspects of our operation, from the academics team using randomised controlled trials to validate the best teaching mechanisms to the customer experience team understanding what is most important to our families to operational teams striving to improve our service delivery efficiency. However, we have reached an inflection point where we need to take our data game to the next level. Instead of just providing data to our various departments, we need to start bringing to bear more sophisticated techniques to unlock the potential of our significant data sets. While we collect tens of thousands of data points every term from each of our academies  from the time spent on each page of a lesson to the billing and payment history of every pupil  we are yet to fully realise the potential energy of these data sets. Were looking for a Director of Business Intelligence, who will report directly to the CTO and who can take this organisational passion for data and translate it into ever more actionable insights for our internal departments, as well as developing develop data insights that will support additional revenue streams and frame Bridge as the premier learning management platform, extending even beyond the academies that we operate. This role is about really nerding out about data; but also translating that passion into tools that will improve all aspects of our service delivery. It will involve collaborating with experts and data scientists/analysts in other departments to deliver meaningful insights, while also pushing and supporting them with techniques that they could not yet begin to imagine. From adaptive curriculum to fraud detection to predictive analytics, the possibilities are endless. The Director of Business Intelligence will oversee a team that includes data warehousing, ETL, and ad hoc analysis, while also working with software development and UX experts to devise and deliver business intelligence products, such as data dashboards \n \nWhat You Will Do  \n \nDefine, architect and build complex large scale real-time data processing platforms \nOversee the design, delivery, and governance of the core data warehouse.  Design and deliver data products (esp. dashboards) to support core Bridge functions, with delivery support from software teams for implementation. Collaborate with data analysts and scientists in other departments to gather requirements and deliver insights.
